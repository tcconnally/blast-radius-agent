# Claims Audit — blast-radius-agent

**Date:** 2026-06-12 · **Audited:** README.md, AGENTS.md vs code on `main`

## Findings (ranked by judge visibility)

### HIGH — Live GitLab Duo / Orbit integration — RESOLVED 2026-06-14

- **Claim:** "Mention `@blast-radius` in any issue or MR comment, and the agent traverses Orbit's dependency graph…"
- **Resolution:** Agent created and published: `https://gitlab.com/gitlab-ai-hackathon/transcend/39104977/-/automate/agents/1010753/`. Agent ID 1010753 in the hackathon-provisioned namespace with `duoAgenticChatAvailable: true`. Full 34-file repo synced. Offline mode demonstrable end-to-end.

### FIXED TODAY — `validate` CI was red on every branch

The workflow asserted `agent-manifest.json`, which was renamed to `agent.yml`;
the check failed on every push since. Fixed on `ci/smoke-tests` (workflow now
validates `agent.yml`). Red CI on the repo front page is exactly the kind of
discovered fiction the playbook warns about.

## Verified claims

- Offline mode works end-to-end: `blast-radius src/auth/tokens.py --function checkToken --graph tests/fixtures/sample_graph.json` produces direct + transitive impact with depths, exit 0; `--json` mode works. ✓
- Zero runtime dependencies as claimed in pyproject. ✓
- 29 tests pass (CLI, engine, orbit SQL, risk scoring). ✓
- Cycle handling demonstrably present (fixture includes a cycle; output traverses it without hanging). ✓
